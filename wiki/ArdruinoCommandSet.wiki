This section describes the command mapping used to alter the state of an arduino connected via the andruino web service. Each instruction in the protocol will consist to 3 bytes.

=== AVR PORT Description ===

||Register Name|| Function||
||DDR||Data direction register, sets pin states as Input or Output||
||PORT||
||PIN


=== AVR IO Layout ===
||Port||Pins||Notes|| 
||B||8-13||9-11 support PWM||
||C||0-5||Analog Inputs only||
||D||2-7||3,5,6 Support PWM Pins 0-1 reserved for serial IO||

== Serial Communication ==
Communication between the host machine and avr consists of two main command types (Read / Write). A read command request will trigger the avr to return 
a full list of all IO buffers on the device (See Read-Output below). Write commands on the other hand are more complex.

Write commands contain the following syntax:
Note: current design does not include analog ports

 # Command byte 
 # Register Address
 # Register Data

===_Note: Map specific to Atmel 168 (Standard) Arduino Current release will not include support for PORT-C (This is the analog interface for the ardunio)_===
