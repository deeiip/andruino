Remote interface for controlling the Arduino micro controller via an Android application that uses a Python-based web service that one may run on the computer with the Arduino attached to it.  This project primarily exists to fulfill the requirements for our Software Engineering Project, but we hope the project matures to the point that geeks everywhere will be using Andruino to open the garage, turn on lights, lock the doors, and feed the dog.
